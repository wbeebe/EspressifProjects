# Espressif Projects
A collection of projects I've hacked over time for programming Espressif MCUs.
Languages used are C/C++, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

Each project has a detailed README describing what it is, and what MCU and 
developer board it targets.
### ESP32-C3-I2C-DISPLAYS
A project heavily derived from an LED flasher example. It uses the RGB LED
as well as an alphanumeric LED display and a pair of LED matrix display boards.
All the displays came from Adafruit, and are controlled on the I2C buss.

The project README doesn't match complete reality, but it's correct as far
as it goes.
